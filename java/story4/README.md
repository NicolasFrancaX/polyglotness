STORY 4
-------

As s TAXONOMIST I want a graphical interface (desktop, mobile or web) to consume that REST API, view the images and its tags, comments and description + the author details.
and allows me to classify that images selecting between 5 categories ('food', 'animal', 'place', 'person', 'object') and I want the classification data to go to a MongoDB Database.
